### Manual containerization of Hello World UI
From the root of the repository run the below steps:
1. To build the docker image run: `docker build . --no-cache -t us.gcr.io/broad-dsp-gcr-public/terra-batch-analysis-ui:<tag>`
2. Next, to run the app: `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 us.gcr.io/broad-dsp-gcr-public/terra-batch-analysis-ui:<tag>`. The app should be hosted on port 8080
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` to load the Hello World UI
4. To push the image to GCR, run: `docker push us.gcr.io/broad-dsp-gcr-public/terra-batch-analysis-ui:<tag>`

Note: Don't forget to stop the docker container after use. One can run the below commands to stop and remove the container:
```
docker stop <container_id>
docker rm <container_id>
```

-----------------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Guide [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/cra-template/template/README.md).

Builds/deploying handled by CircleCI.

### Feature requests
Requests related to the funtionality or usability of the UI can be submitted as issues on this repo. However, as features often impact multiple components of the Terra platform, we recommend users submit feature requests through the main Terra feature request [page](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/community/topics/360000500452). See this [article](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/community/posts/360040112171) for more details.

### Developing

1. We use Node 16 (the current LTS) and Yarn. On Darwin with Homebrew:

    ```sh
    brew install node@16 yarn; brew link node@16 --force --overwrite
    ```
2. Install deps:

    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```
3. Start development server, which will report any lint violations as well:

    ```sh
    yarn start
    ```

    If you get an error that resembles:

    ```
    Failed to compile.

    ./node_modules/react-dev-utils/webpackHotDevClient.js
    Error: [BABEL] /Users/.../terra-ui/node_modules/react-scripts/node_modules/react-dev-utils/webpackHotDevClient.js: Cannot find module '...'
    Require stack:
    - ...
    - ...
    - ... (While processing: "...js")
    ```

    try:

    ```sh
    rm -rf node_modules
    yarn install
    yarn start
    ```
4. Testing:

    ```sh
    yarn test
    ```
6. Code style and linting:
    * On command line within the repo's root dir: `yarn lint`
      * Eslint will fix as many violations as possible. It will report any that it can't fix itself.
    * In an IDE other than IntelliJ (VS Code, etc): install the eslint plugin from your package manager, and there should be a command to fix issues at any time.
    * In IntelliJ:
        * Styles should be automatically applied by [.editorconfig](.editorconfig); make sure you've also [turned on eslint](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/eslint.html#ws_js_eslint_automatic_configuration).
        * In order to correctly format a file at any time, run the IntelliJ `Reformat Code` action, and then right-click in a window and click `Fix ESLint Problems`. You could also create an IntelliJ macro to do this for you as explained [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-macros-in-the-editor.html#reformat_on_save), and map running of the macro to a keyboard shortcut for convenience.
